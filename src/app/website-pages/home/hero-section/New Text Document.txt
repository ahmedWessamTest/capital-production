Explanation of the Error

The error in your code, where clicking custom dots didn’t change the slide, occurred because the ngx-owl-carousel-o library’s to() method expects a string slide ID, but you were passing a numeric index (e.g., 0, 1). Your slides lacked explicit [id] attributes, so the library generated default IDs (e.g., owl-slide-0), which didn’t match the indices. This mismatch caused the owlCar.to(index) call in goToSlide to fail, as it couldn’t find a slide with an ID like "0".

Root Cause:

    No Slide IDs: Without [id]="slide.id" in the <ng-template carouselSlide>, the library auto-generates IDs that don’t align with your index-based logic.
    Incorrect to() Usage: Passing a number to to() doesn’t work unless the slide ID is a string matching that number, which wasn’t the case.
    Custom Dots: Your custom dots relied on indices, but the carousel navigation needed string IDs, breaking the connection.

Symptoms:

    Clicking a dot updated activeSlide visually but didn’t move the carousel.
    The carousel worked for autoplay and dragging but not for dot navigation.

Fix Applied:

    Added string id properties to the slides array (e.g., slide-1).
    Updated goToSlide to use this.slides[index].id to pass the correct slide ID.
    Ensured slides have [id]="slide.id" in the template.
